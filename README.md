# SmartBrain-api - v3
Final project for ZTM course - Advanced

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. You must add your own API key in the `controllers/image.js` file to connect to Clarifai API.
5. You will need a redis server and a postgreSQL server running on your machine for this to work. Connect them in your server.js based on your own details.

You can grab Clarifai API key [here](https://www.clarifai.com/)

** Make sure you use postgreSQL instead of mySQL for this code base.
